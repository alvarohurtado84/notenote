# notenote

Notenote is... I do not know what. It is something related with blogging, maybe.

Notenote was born as something very different. A good friend designed a logo I love for me and I bought a domain so I am going to recycle that.

### How?

I will use Django + Django Rest Framework in the backend side. I will use ReactJS in frontend.

### Why?

- Because I want to learn how to build APIs.
- Because I want to learn how to build Single Page Applications.
- Because I want to use that brand for something
- Because why not.
